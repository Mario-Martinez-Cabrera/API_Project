# API_Project

Final project for the APIs course of the Meta Back-End professional certificate. 

Create a fully functioning API project for the Little Lemon restaurant 
so that the client application developers can use the APIs to 
develop web and mobile applications. People with different roles will 
be able to browse, add and edit menu items, place orders, browse orders, 
assign delivery crew to orders and finally deliver the orders.

Used VS Code, Insomnia, and Django Rest Framework.
